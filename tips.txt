====versioning====

In version 1.9.0.1:

1: Major revision (new UI, lots of new features, conceptual change, etc.)
9: Minor revision (maybe a change to a search box, 1 feature added, collection of bug fixes)
0: Bug fix release
1: Build number (if used)â€”that's why you see the .NET framework using something like 2.0.4.2709
